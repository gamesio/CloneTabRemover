# CloneTabRemover
Clone Tab Remover is a browser extension born from my exigence of not having multiple clone tabs on my Chrome window.
I will try my best to add some more features when I have some spare time, but I will for sure create some versions also for other browsers.(e.g. FireFox)

# Features
* Automatically check if you are trying to open any clone tab, if so close it and redirect to the already open one.

# The Future
As I said I would like to add some more feature, to give you an idea of the plan:
## Chrome: 
* 2.0) Add a pop-up menu to choose if close or not the new tab.
* 3.0) Divide the "Never Ask Again"  box for each site.
## Firefox: 
* 1.0) Same as Chrome 2.0.
* 2.0) Same as Chrome 3.0.
